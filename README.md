# Matlab
MATLAB is a high-performance language for technical computing. It integrates computation, visualization, and programming environment. There are toolboxes for signal processing, symbolic computation, control theory, simulation, optimization, and several other fields of applied science and engineering. It's interactive environment that enables to perform computationally intensive tasks faster than with traditional programming languages such as C, C++, and FORTRAN.

# Repository
