# Matlab
MATLAB is a high-performance language for technical computing. It integrates computation, visualization, and programming environment. There are toolboxes for signal processing, symbolic computation, control theory, simulation, optimization, and several other fields of applied science and engineering. It's interactive environment that enables to perform computationally intensive tasks faster than with traditional programming languages such as C, C++, and FORTRAN.

# VisionÂ 
This repository has been generated to provide various types of basic matlab programming solution which may help engineering student to speed up their skills during their numerical techniques or signal processing studies.
